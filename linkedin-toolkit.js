            about: `After a 25-year career in Finance, Infrastructure, and EDGE Data Solutions, I am now deploying my terminal CAIO (Chief AI Officer) package. My mission is simple: How can I help save you time?

🎯 THE MISSION: Bridge the gap between today's corporate leaders and the AI-driven future—while donating my time and technology to co-found Luxury Marine Life (LML) and GARMN to ensure no student is left behind.

I am looking for consulting contracts from large companies, Board Members, and CEOs ready to lead. Parallel to this, I am an expert in Small Business Strategy and capital formation for ultra-wealthy individuals looking for tax-advantaged assets.

THE TRACK RECORD:
- Built $1.5B+ in data center infrastructure with EDGE Data Solutions.
- Developed proprietary EDGE Fluids immersion cooling technology.
- Co-founded GARMN (501c3) to bridge Finance, Yachts, and Community.

WHAT I DEPLOY:
✅ Fractional CAIO & AI Infrastructure Strategy
✅ Strategic Capital Formation & IR Expert Services
✅ Tax-Advantaged Assets & Section 179 Optimization
✅ Smart Marina & Luxury Marine Infrastructure

I believe that giving back is the only way to build a real empire. Let's help others win.

🚀 Now accepting Corporate Consulting & Board Advisory Roles.

For the last 3 years, I've been heads-down developing EDGE Fluids immersion AI datacenters and blockchain mining operations. I've been investing my time and capital into the infrastructure of the next decade.

Today, I am opening my terminal CAIO (Chief AI Officer) consulting practice.

I am looking for consulting contracts from large companies to help them transition to decentralized AI systems.

But the mission doesn't stop at corporate. I am here to help others win. I am donating my time and technology to local Miami companies, non-profits, and students with business, technology, and capital needs.

Here's my quick infrastructure audit checklist (save this):

□ CRM automation (leads → follow-up)
□ Document processing (contracts, invoices)
□ Customer service (chatbots, tickets)
□ Reporting (dashboards, analytics)
□ Scheduling (bookings, calendars)

If 3+ boxes are unchecked, you're leaving money on the table.

I help businesses fix this with my Fractional CAIO model.

The twist? 50% of my fee goes to charity.

A marina owner asked me this last month.

Here's what we did:

1. Structured a private placement through First Look Equities
2. Leveraged Section 179 for immediate write-off
3. Set up an AI system to manage bookings (30% efficiency gain)
4. Committed 10% of savings to marine conservation

Result: 
→ $500K+ in tax savings
→ Automated operations
→ $50K to ocean cleanup

This is the Give Back Challenge in action.

            post: `I've worked with $1.5B+ in infrastructure deals.

Here are 3 things I learned that most people get wrong:

1️⃣ Tax efficiency > Revenue
Making $1M means nothing if you're paying 40% to the IRS. Structure first.

2️⃣ AI isn't optional anymore
If you're not automating, your competitor is. Period.

3️⃣ Legacy > Wealth
The businesses that last are the ones that give back.

This is why I created the Give Back Challenge.
